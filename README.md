# COPC Viewer

CesiumJS-native COPC point cloud visualization library prototype.

## Goal

Allow a CesiumJS developer to load a COPC file or URL directly into a Cesium scene without pre-converting it to 3D Tiles.

This project handles already-created COPC files. It does not target live LiDAR input, a general point cloud viewer app, or a COPC-to-3D-Tiles conversion pipeline.

## First Prototype Target

The current prototype is intentionally small:

1. Render hardcoded points in CesiumJS.
2. Open and inspect a COPC file or URL.
3. Read a small set of real XYZ points.
4. Transform the sample COPC CRS into Cesium-friendly longitude, latitude, and height.
5. Display sampled COPC hierarchy-node points in CesiumJS.

Full LOD, persistent cache management, workers, custom primitives, packaging, and advanced styling come later.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

The runnable prototype lives in `examples/basic-viewer`. The root `src` folder contains reusable COPC and Cesium integration code used by that example.
Reusable source entry points are `src/index.ts`, `src/core/index.ts`, and `src/cesium/index.ts`; package exports expose them as `copc-viewer`, `copc-viewer/core`, and `copc-viewer/cesium`.
`CopcPointCloudLayer` is the first thin Cesium-facing API: it owns a `CopcSource`, point renderer, bounds renderer, and simple camera-based node rendering helpers.

The default example URL loads the public Autzen COPC sample, reads the root hierarchy node, samples up to 5,000 points, and renders them in CesiumJS.
The hierarchy node selector lists nodes from the root hierarchy page and lets the example render one selected node at a time.
`CopcSource` keeps the opened COPC metadata, hierarchy page, and sampled node point data in memory for the active URL.
The example also computes the selected node bounds and renders a yellow debug bounding box in CesiumJS.
It can suggest the nearest loaded hierarchy node to the current camera position and apply that suggestion on demand.
The manual render set can combine multiple hierarchy nodes and render their sampled points together.
The Auto LOD button selects a few nearby root-hierarchy nodes from the current camera position and viewport height, then renders them through the same multi-node path.

## API Sketch

```ts
import { CopcPointCloudLayer } from "copc-viewer";

const layer = new CopcPointCloudLayer(viewer.scene, { url });
const { hierarchy } = await layer.load();

await layer.renderNode(hierarchy.nodes[0].key);
await layer.renderAutomatic({ camera: viewer.camera, maxNodes: 4 });

layer.destroy();
```
