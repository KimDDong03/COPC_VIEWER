# Release Procedure

Releases are manual and intentional. The `Release Candidate` workflow produces
evidence and a package candidate; it does not publish to npm or create a GitHub
release. The separate `Publish npm Package` workflow is manual-only, requires
the protected `npm` GitHub Environment, an existing matching version tag, and
an explicit confirmation input.

## 1. Prepare

1. Start from a clean, reviewed commit on the intended release branch.
2. Choose the semantic version and update `package.json`, `package-lock.json`,
   and `CHANGELOG.md` together.
   Before the first tag, keep all entries under `Unreleased`; the tag-triggered
   workflow rejects any `v*` tag that does not exactly equal the package version.
3. Confirm the public API, browser/bundler runtime target, Node development
   toolchain, and Cesium compatibility range.
4. Regenerate `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `docs/sbom.spdx.json` after every
   dependency or lockfile change.
5. Confirm sample-data provenance and that no dataset bytes enter the package.

## 2. Verify

Run from a clean clone with Node 22 and the package-manager version declared in
`package.json`:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run license:evidence:self-test
npm audit
npm run qc:contest-device
npm pack --dry-run
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Preserve the package tarball, checksum, JSON reports, screenshots, and actual
WebGL renderer. Confirm each benchmark's machine-readable `runEvidence` records
the expected UTC, commit SHA, clean/dirty state, source fingerprint, runtime,
and browser version; a dirty candidate must be explained and rerun from the
final clean commit before publication. Confirm the GitHub CI, browser smoke,
and CodeQL runs for that same SHA.
Also confirm `output/package-smoke/browser-result.json` retains the same
validated `runEvidence` together with the exact `releaseCandidateArtifact`
tarball byte length and SHA-256; this is the source-to-candidate identity link.

## 3. Stage a candidate

Trigger `.github/workflows/release-candidate.yml` manually. Download the
artifact and verify that it contains:

- the `.tgz` package candidate;
- the adjacent `.tgz.sha256` checksum generated from that exact candidate;
- renderer and smoothness JSON;
- browser smoke screenshots;
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `docs/sbom.spdx.json`.

Install that exact tarball into a fresh consumer project before approval. Do
not rebuild a different tarball for publication. Record the successful
`Release Candidate` workflow run ID; the publish workflow requires it and
rejects a run from any other workflow, commit, or conclusion.

## 4. Publish

Publishing, tagging, and GitHub release creation require maintainer approval.
Before publishing:

- verify the npm account, organization, package name, access level, and 2FA or
  trusted-publishing configuration;
- verify the tarball SHA-256 and unpacked file list;
- create an annotated Git tag that exactly matches the package version;
- configure the GitHub `npm` Environment with required reviewers;
- configure npm trusted publishing for repository
  `KimDDong03/COPC_VIEWER`, workflow `npm-publish.yml`, and environment `npm`;
- for the first publication only, when trusted publishing cannot yet be bound
  to the new package, place a short-lived granular `NPM_TOKEN` in that protected
  environment and remove it immediately after trusted publishing is enabled;
- manually dispatch `Publish npm Package` on the exact tag, set
  `confirm_publish`, and provide the approved Release Candidate run ID; the
  workflow reruns release QC, downloads the approved same-SHA artifact,
  verifies its checksum, requires the locally reproduced tarball SHA to match,
  and publishes the downloaded approved tarball with npm provenance;
- attach the approved candidate and checksums to the GitHub release;
- verify a clean consumer install from the public registry.

The publish job has `id-token: write` for Sigstore/npm OIDC and never runs on a
push by itself. Prefer trusted publishing over a long-lived token. After the
registry install, run `npm audit signatures` from a clean consumer to verify
registry signatures and provenance attestations. The configuration follows the
current npm guidance for
[trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/) and
[provenance statements](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements/).

Never force-move a published tag or silently replace release assets. Correct a
bad release with a documented patch version or deprecation notice.

## 5. Post-release

- Confirm README links, security reporting, API docs, declarations, worker
  assets, and Cesium static-asset setup from the installed package. Source maps
  and TypeScript sources are intentionally not part of the current package.
- Record the public npm and GitHub release URLs in `CHANGELOG.md` link
  references.
- Keep the release commit and evidence artifacts reachable for contest review.
- For a competition award, retain the public source repository for the period
  required by the official rules.
