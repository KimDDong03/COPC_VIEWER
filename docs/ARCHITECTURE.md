# Architecture

`copc-cesium` is a TypeScript library prototype for loading COPC point cloud data directly into CesiumJS.

The library is intentionally not a standalone viewer product. The example app exists to prove and demonstrate the reusable API.

## Goals

- Open a COPC file or URL in the browser.
- Inspect COPC metadata and hierarchy.
- Read selected point-data nodes with HTTP range requests.
- Convert COPC source coordinates into Cesium-friendly longitude, latitude, and height.
- Render sampled points in a Cesium scene.
- Provide a small Cesium-facing API that can grow into a reusable layer or primitive.

## Non-Goals

- No COPC-to-3D-Tiles conversion pipeline.
- No live LiDAR or sensor ingestion.
- No general point cloud editing/viewer application.
- No full production LOD, eviction policy, worker pool, or custom WebGL primitive in the first milestone.

## Layers

```text
src/core/
  COPC metadata, hierarchy, range reads, point sample preparation, cache state

src/cesium/
  Cesium scene integration, coordinate transforms, point and bounds rendering

examples/basic-viewer/
  Minimal browser demonstration of the reusable library
```

## Data Flow

```text
COPC URL
-> CopcSource
-> COPC metadata and loaded hierarchy pages
-> optional camera-targeted hierarchy page expansion
-> selected hierarchy node keys
-> range-read point data
-> sampled source XYZ points
-> coordinate transform
-> Cesium PointPrimitiveCollection
```

## Streaming Semantics

In this prototype, streaming means loading COPC hierarchy and point-data byte ranges on demand as the camera or selected node set changes.

The current implementation includes:

- `CopcSource.loadHierarchyPage` and `loadNextHierarchyPage` for on-demand COPC hierarchy page range reads.
- `selectHierarchyPagesForTarget` for choosing nearby pending hierarchy pages from their octree bounds.
- `CopcSource` point sample caching by node key and sample count.
- `selectHierarchyNodesForCamera` for simple camera-based node selection.
- `CopcPointCloudLayer.expandHierarchyForCamera` for camera-targeted hierarchy expansion.
- `CopcPointCloudLayer.renderAutomatic` for selecting and rendering nodes in one call.
- `CopcPointCloudLayer.selectNodesForCamera` for selecting nodes without immediately rendering.
- Example-only `Stream on camera move` behavior that reruns hierarchy expansion, camera selection, and cached sample rendering.

The current streaming behavior is deliberately conservative. It limits the number of hierarchy pages opened per camera update and keeps example camera-stream rendering shallow so the prototype remains stable in a browser smoke test.

## Coordinate Transforms

`src/core` keeps points in source COPC XYZ coordinates. `src/cesium` converts them through a `coordinateTransforms` hook.

Available prototype paths:

- Geographic coordinates.
- Built-in EPSG:2992 handling for the public Autzen sample.
- `createProj4CoordinateTransforms` for projected CRS data when a proj4 definition is provided.

Camera-based selection requires both directions:

- `toCesium` for rendering source points.
- `toCopc` for mapping the Cesium camera position back to COPC source coordinates.

## Current Limitations

- Hierarchy page expansion is camera-targeted but still conservative; it is not yet a full screen-space error or eviction policy.
- Point rendering uses Cesium point primitives, not a custom optimized WebGL primitive.
- Cache is in-memory and unbounded.
- Camera streaming is prototype-oriented; it expands a small number of hierarchy pages per update while keeping the example's automatic render depth shallow.
- CRS detection is not complete; projected CRS data should pass explicit transform options.

## Near-Term Roadmap

1. Expand cache policy with explicit limits and invalidation.
2. Add a better screen-space error policy for progressive hierarchy and point loading.
3. Add bounded hierarchy and point cache eviction.
4. Move heavy point decoding/preparation work into Web Workers.
5. Replace point primitive rendering with a more scalable Cesium-native primitive path when the basic API stabilizes.
