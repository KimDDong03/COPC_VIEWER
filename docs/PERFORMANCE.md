# Performance Notes

`copc-cesium` is still a prototype, so performance claims should be backed by
repeatable browser measurements instead of fixed guarantees.

## Smoothness Benchmark

Run:

```bash
npm run benchmark:smoothness
```

The benchmark builds the basic viewer, opens each configured COPC sample in a
real browser, enables `Stream on camera move`, changes the camera-stream point
budget, moves the Cesium camera, and records `requestAnimationFrame` intervals
plus stream-stage timing.

The result is written to:

```text
output/smoothness-benchmark/smoothness.json
```

Useful overrides:

```powershell
$env:COPC_SMOOTHNESS_SAMPLES="autzen-classified,sofi-stadium"
$env:COPC_SMOOTHNESS_POINT_BUDGETS="2500,5000,10000"
$env:COPC_SMOOTHNESS_REPEATS="5"
$env:COPC_SMOOTHNESS_MIN_SELECTED_DEPTH="2"
npm run benchmark:smoothness
```

The bundled smoothness sample cases expect camera streaming to select at least
depth 2, so a run does not pass just because it fell back to a shallower and
cheaper LOD. `COPC_SMOOTHNESS_MIN_SELECTED_DEPTH` can raise, lower, or disable
that global threshold for local experiments.

## Current Default

The basic viewer starts in Balanced detail mode: 20,000 max points per node,
10,000 max camera-stream points, and 3 px point primitives. The stream input
acts as a maximum budget: camera streaming can lower the effective point budget
after slow visible updates and gradually recover it after repeated fast updates.
This keeps the demo from staying overloaded on heavier samples or slower
machines.

Additional targeted diagnostics on the SoFi sample with a 2,500-point stream
budget originally measured average stream-stage timing at
expand/select/render/total `234.3/127.2/10.0/470.0 ms`. After limiting Cesium
frustum checks to the requested camera selection depth range, a follow-up run
measured expand/apply/select/render/total
`240.7/105.1/19.0/10.7/375.5 ms`.

After avoiding full node-dropdown rebuilds during camera streaming, the same
targeted check measured expand/apply/select/render/total
`220.2/0.1/0.6/17.1/238.0 ms`, with 60.0 average FPS, 16.80 ms p95 frame time,
and 0 frames over 50 ms.

After moving camera-targeted hierarchy expansion out of the visible stream
update and into a single background prefetch queue, the targeted visible-update
check measured expand/apply/select/render/total
`0.0/0.0/3.0/30.4/33.5 ms`, with 59.4 average FPS, 16.80 ms p95 frame time, and
0 frames over 50 ms.

After allowing camera streaming to select up to two nearby depth-2 nodes, the
same targeted check measured depth avg `2.0`, expand/apply/select/render/total
`0.0/0.0/1.5/17.5/19.0 ms`, with 60.0 average FPS, 16.70 ms p95 frame time,
and 0 frames over 50 ms.

After adding adaptive camera-stream point budgeting, a targeted SoFi run with a
20,000-point maximum stream budget and 2 repeats kept depth avg `2.0` while
lowering the effective render count from 2,668 to 1,000 points after a slow
update. The run measured 59.7 average FPS, 16.80 ms p95 frame time, 33.50 ms
max frame time, and 0 frames over 50 ms. This improves smoothness by sacrificing
temporary point density when the visible stream update is too expensive.

Rendering the submitted points was not the dominant cost in these runs. The
visible camera-stream update is now mostly renderer submission time, while
hierarchy page expansion happens in the background.

This means the next performance work should validate the depth-2 setting across
larger external COPC samples, then tune how much hierarchy to prefetch for
visual quality and deeper LOD. 10,000 and 20,000 points are currently best
treated as stress cases, not defaults.
