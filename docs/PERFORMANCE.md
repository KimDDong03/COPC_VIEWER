# Performance Notes

`copc-cesium` is still a prototype, so performance claims should be backed by
repeatable browser measurements instead of fixed guarantees.

## Smoothness Benchmark

Run:

```bash
npm run benchmark:smoothness
```

The benchmark builds the basic viewer, opens each configured COPC sample in a
real browser, enables `Stream on camera move`, changes the camera-stream point
budget, moves the Cesium camera, and records `requestAnimationFrame` intervals
plus stream-stage timing.

The result is written to:

```text
output/smoothness-benchmark/smoothness.json
```

Useful overrides:

```powershell
$env:COPC_SMOOTHNESS_SAMPLES="autzen-classified,sofi-stadium"
$env:COPC_SMOOTHNESS_POINT_BUDGETS="2500,5000,10000"
$env:COPC_SMOOTHNESS_REPEATS="5"
npm run benchmark:smoothness
```

## Current Default

The basic viewer keeps the camera-stream point budget at 5,000 points by
default. In the current local benchmark it was reasonable for the Autzen sample,
but SoFi still produced long frames even at 2,500 points.

Additional targeted diagnostics on the SoFi sample with a 2,500-point stream
budget originally measured average stream-stage timing at
expand/select/render/total `234.3/127.2/10.0/470.0 ms`. After limiting Cesium
frustum checks to the requested camera selection depth range, a follow-up run
measured expand/apply/select/render/total
`240.7/105.1/19.0/10.7/375.5 ms`.

Rendering the submitted points was not the dominant cost in either run. The
selection phase is now lower, and the remaining large costs are hierarchy page
expansion and applying the expanded hierarchy to the example UI state.

This means the next performance work should focus on camera-stream scheduling
and hierarchy expansion cost, not simply lowering the render point count. 10,000
and 20,000 points are currently best treated as stress cases, not defaults.
